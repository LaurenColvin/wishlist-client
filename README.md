## Project Description

Wishlist is an online shopping app to help you plan your purchases. So much better than having a million tabs open and carts filled with items you canâ€™t remember at 20 different stores. Put all of your ideal items in one place to better plan and save up for your dream wardrobe! This app will also help with budgeting and making sure you are making the best purchase at the best price.


This app includes a backend database using MongoDB and Express.js and a frontend web application using Node.js and React.

## User Stories

Wishlist is for all avid shoppers who love to plan out outfits for every big event and occasion. They are constantly looking for the next best dress, shoe or coat but can't decided when to actually pull the trigger. They are left making impulse purchases that don't actually live up to what they wanted. Our user needs a better way to shop and keep track of all the best items on the market!

Wishlist will be the first thing they open before starting the hunt. As they visit sites and find something they like, they will add a link, photo and price to Wishlist with a quick form. Soon their wishlist will be full of amazing ideas and they can compare by price and style across all of their favorite brands. When they think they have made a decision they can add the item to their cart and checkout their budget to make sure they have enough spend for the month to buy their dream items!

Finally once the purchase has been made their new item will be added to their wardrobe and the rest of the items will get pushed to an archive, incase they want to add it back to a wishlist for another occasion. Shop smarter, not harder.

## Code Snippet

Here is my function that adds or removes an item from the cart. First it checks if the item was already in the cart before determining which to do.

```js
const putItemCart = (item) => {
        let check = props.cartItems.filter((n) => n._id === props.item._id);
        let itemsCopy = []
        if (check.length >= 1) {
            itemsCopy = props.cartItems.filter((n) => n._id != props.item._id);
            setCartRemove(true)
            setTimeout(function() {
                setCartRemove(false);
                }, 1000);
        } else {
            itemsCopy = [...props.cartItems];
            itemsCopy.push(item);
            setCartSuccess(true)
            setTimeout(function() {
                setCartSuccess(false);
                }, 1000);
        }
}
```

## Issues and Resolutions

**ERROR**:
I wanted to implement an alert for "added to cart". Needed it to disappear after a few seconds and show up onClick.

**RESOLUTION**:
Discovered the setTimeout() function so the alert would disappear after a set amount of time.
